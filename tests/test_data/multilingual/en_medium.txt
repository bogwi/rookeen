Prime Numbers as Cosmic Debris

Imagine infinity as a process, not just a static concept—a relentless loop where some cosmic counter keeps ticking upward, +=1, step by step, forever. This counter is like a ship barreling through the number line, and as it accelerates toward some ultimate limit (say, the speed of light, *c*, as a stand-in for the boundary of comprehension), it starts shedding "debris." In this analogy, the primes—2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on—could be the fragments that break off, the irreducible chunks that resist being broken down by the ship’s machinery (division, in this case). Everything else, the composite numbers, gets ground up or fused together, while primes are the stubborn survivors, flung out into the void.
